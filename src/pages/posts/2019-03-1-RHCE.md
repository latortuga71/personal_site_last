<h1> RHCE Post Exam Thoughts </h1>
<p>
Just Passed RHCE with a 261/300. I was able to complete RHCSA and RHCE in about 4 months time while working as a SOC analyst.
I'm really happy with my knowledge after these two exams as i went from having very entry level linux knowledge to being able to confidently
manage linux servers and devices without any fear. If anyone likes using certs to gain knowledge and be rewarded after the intense studying. For linux knowledge these two exams are the way to go. RHCE was easier than RHCSA in my opinion even though i over prepared. Details on how to prep for RHCE can be found on my reddit post
