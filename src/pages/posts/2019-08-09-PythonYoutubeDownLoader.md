<h1> Python Automated Youtube Downloader </h1>
<p>
Found my old iphone 6 wanted to get some music on it, quickly wrote quick script to get music from youtube
shout out to this package making it very easy
{% highlight python %}
import youtube_dl
{% endhighlight %}
this took me about 20 mins mostly research about a year ago it would have taken hours.
progress is very interesting.
