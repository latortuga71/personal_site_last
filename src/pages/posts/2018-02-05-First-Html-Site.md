<h1>First HTML/CSS Project </h1>
<p>
First ever web related project, i had never ever viewed source code for a webpage. So i bought<em><strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1547421214&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=html">this book  </a> </strong></em>and decided i would make a website. Now looking back i know for a fact i'm more of a back end type of guy as you can see from the blandness of it.
