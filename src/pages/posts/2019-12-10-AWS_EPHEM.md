<h1>AWS Ephemeral Workspaces</h1>
<p>
Got tasked with creating a solution for remote employees in which data they save, will not persist after a reboot. In my case i leveraged AWS Lambda functions to make this possible, Basically one function watches cloud trail for when a workspaces is created. That function then creates an alarm that will run a lambda function (the main one) when the user is disconnected (cloud watch metric alert) this big function waits 10 minutes then checks if the user has reconnected since then, if not it will destroy that workspace completely. A third lambda function watches cloud trail for the terminate workspace call. This will in turn destroy the alarm that was created in the first place. After the workspace is terminated it is rebuilt from an image and that creation in turn triggers the the first function.
