<h1> PHP App that allows uploads/gets user information </h1>
<p>
Created a php site that shows your public ip, hosted it on heroku and it shows your heroku private ip, also has section that if authenticated you can upload/download files. Learned alot about cookies,sessions and blocking ipâ€™s. The source code is <a href="https://github.com/latortuga71/Public_ip_PHP">here</a> and the actual site is <a href="https://white-wolf-ip.herokuapp.com/index.php">here</a>
